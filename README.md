# SourceMe
SourceMe is a forum web application made for a DevOps school project, built by a team of four students:
<ul>
  <li>Rebecca Ngoh (leader)</li>
  <li>Jaslyn Yap</li>
  <li>Zann Lee</li>
  <li>Amanda Kong</li>
</ul>

Users can ask questions, answer questions, read tutorials, and <i><b>bookmark questions</b></i> (not currently working).

We couldn't implement our bookmark feature due to time constraints, but we're planning to work on it in the future. Please ignore any bookmark-related files for the time being.

Thanks for visiting our repository. Happy browsing!
